# Bridge Pattern

- Decouple an abstarction from its implementation so the two can vary independently
- Bridge allows you to implement these inheritances without tightly binding to their abstractions.
- Bridge also differs from Adapter in that Bridge is used when designing new systems while Adapter is used to adapt old systems to new ones.
